  Recurrence Quantification Analysis
}
\description{
  This package peforms several variants of recurrence quantification analysis
  (RQA) on both categorical and continuous time series. In addition, the 
  package provides the capability of performing cross RQA, joint RQA, and
  multidimensional RQA. In each case, the package calculates the standard 
  battery of recurrence plot metrics (e.g., recurrence rate, determinism,
  trapping time, etc...). The package also follows Coco and Dale (2015)
  by allowing the user to profile cross-recurrence plots by only looking at 
  diagonal recurrence points.
